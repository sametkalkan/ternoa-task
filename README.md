The project consists of two parts: frontend and backend.
First of all, npm, nodejs and mongo db must be installed.

Then go through following steps:

1. open mongo db and create a DB called "ternoa"
2. locate to "frontend" directory and run "npm start" command.
3. locate to "backend" directory and run "node bin/www" command.
4. Open "localhost:3000" on browser.
